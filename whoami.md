# Whoami
-------------------------------
<i>Hi Everyone,
My name is Fatih. I'm working in an insurance information and monitoring center as Application Security Specialist since March 2024.
I worked in a bank as Penetration Tester/Red Teamer between October 2022 and March 2024.
Before that, I worked on a Cyber Security Consultant firm as Penetration Tester/Red Teamer 
between 2019 and 2022. I'm making small updates on blog because I want to blog again.
I also joined [![GitHub](/img/synack.png){:height="20px" width="20px"} Synack Red Team](https://www.synack.com/red-team/) on last month of 2023 so I started to bug bounty finally  :) You can follow me these platforms:
